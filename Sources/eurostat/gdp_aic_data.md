## Context

Actual Individual Consumption (AIC) is a measure of material welfare of households. It consists of goods and services consumed by individuals, irrespective of whether these goods and services are purchased and paid for by households, by government, or by non-profit institutions.

GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living, although it is not a comprehensive measure of economic development. AIC per capita is an alternative indicator better adapted to describe the material welfare situation of households.

The comparison of Italian households' savings behavior with consumption patterns reveals important insights into financial decision-making and economic resilience across the lifecycle.
