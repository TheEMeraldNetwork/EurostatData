This repository contains data analysis and visualizations supporting the LinkedIn article "The €1.5 Trillion Euros Paradox of Italian Households" by Davide Consiglio, Country Data Officer at Generali Italia.

## Key Findings

1. Italian households hold more than €1.5 trillion in cash deposits, representing a significant portion of their financial assets.
2. Compared to other EU countries, Italy shows a disproportionately high ratio of currency and deposits to insurance products (150.2% vs 116.0% EU average).
3. The current inflation environment (>5% in recent years) erodes the real value of these liquid assets over time.
4. Advanced data analytics can help the insurance industry better understand household needs across their lifecycle.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on Eurostat data on financial assets and liabilities of households across EU countries, as published in the [Households - statistics on financial assets and liabilities](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Households_-_statistics_on_financial_assets_and_liabilities) report.

## Publication Plan

The LinkedIn post is scheduled for publication on April 29th, 2025 at 10:00 AM CET.
