## Post Overview

This LinkedIn post analyzes the paradox of Italian households holding €1.5 trillion in cash deposits, which are losing value due to inflation, despite the availability of financial products that could better protect their assets.

## Key Points

1. Italian households hold over €1.5 trillion in currency and deposits
2. Compared to other EU countries, Italy shows a disproportionately high ratio of currency to insurance products (150.2% vs EU average 116.0%)
3. With inflation above 5%, these liquid assets are rapidly losing value
4. Advanced data analytics can help insurers better understand household needs across their lifecycle
